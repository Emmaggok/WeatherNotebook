# Weather Notebook (Jupyter)
Weather Notebook is a project I did for the Algorithms and Programming subject of the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics. This project is all about Web Scrapping.
It takes the climatic information obtained from the page https://www.tutiempo.net/ analyzes the data and it is possible to obtain the predominant direction or directions of the wind in a certain period or the average of maximum temperatures during a certain period.

## Usage


You can choose any station that appears on the map on the following page: https://www.tutiempo.net/clima/mapa/

Once there, navigate until you find a weather station that is of your interest and write it down when prompted. For example, the meteorological station of the city of San Carlos de Bariloche is 'SAZS' or that of London is 'EGRB'.

If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook locally you can follow the instructions on the next page:

You can also run it through Google Collab:
